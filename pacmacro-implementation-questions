How should being captured be handled? Should the server update the status of players when they are within x distance of eachother? Or, should players manually tell the server that they have captured another player? If a player has to manually tell the server they've captured someone, then does the other captured player then have to confirm?

How should pellets (scores) be handled? Does the server know the location of the pellets? Does the server tell us when the pellets are? Does the server tell us if our character has hit a pellet? Does the server keep track of a player's score?

How should power up pills be handled? Again, does the server know the location of the pill? Will the server automatically update a player's status based on the proximity to the pill, or does the client have to tell the server that they have collected a powerup pill?

How do we know the start/stop of a game? Right now, we can sort of infer the start and stop of a game based on player ready statuses, but what about stopping a game? What is the definition of a game ending?
